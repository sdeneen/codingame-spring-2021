Sick strat let's go.

General themes:
1. We have to complete more earlier.
2. Figure out completion strategy at the end. Doing a slow rollout of 2 completions per turn performed better than waiting until the last turn to complete everything. Find a more
data driven algorithm to complete in a good way
3. Start thinking about blocking opponent
4. Look at TODOs for optimizations in existing algo


Concrete ideas:
1. Complete Earlier: Max out each size tree at a different limit (i.e. 1 size 1, 2 size 2's, 3 size 3's). If we are at all our limits, COMPLETE (can write a state manager func to see which COMPLETE leaves us with the most sun points in the next N turns)
2. Complete Earlier: During phase 1 and/or 2, if one of our large trees is gonna block another one of our trees, COMPLETE it (maybe limit to high richness)


==== Old =====

Two sequences of play:
1. Sun gathering phase (engine building)
 - Try to GROW
 	 	- Break ties by largest tree
 	 	- (later) Break ties by picking whichever blocks more opponent sun points next turn
 - If we can't grow anything, SEED somewhere if it's free:
 		- position to block (maybe prioritize diagnols, aka "L" shapes, so we can't block ourselves)
		- Prefer areas with higher richness
		- Seed the biggest tree to spread across the forest - prevents blocking ourselves and makes it hardest for opponent

Optimizations:
- Down the road may need to add in logic to COMPLETE earlier to capitalize on high nutrient forest before opponent does

Add a phase 1.5 in here that prioritizes growing in richer areas

2. Point scoring phase (completing trees ftw)
 - This is pretty much the same as the strategy that got us out of Wood league, except prioritize largest trees first since they're closest to completion
 - Optimizations:
	- update getActionForCompleteTreesStrategy to calculate how many sun points it needs fully complete all trees. Then wait until the last possible turn complete everything so we can continue to collect sun points.
    - consider switching to complete phase based on board rather than % of game complete. E.g. N spaces are taken and it'd be better to start collection.
	- consider prioritizing completing trees that will be blocked the next turn
    - think about how to save sun points for future days, right now the algo goes wide across many trees but we may want to go deep

Tips:
- don't forget to check for richness = 0, which are cells that aren't usable

Changelog (most recent first):
FORMAT: (rankBefore -> rankAfter) Description of the change
- (see prev -> 92 Legend!!!!!!!!!!!) Fixes bugs in scoring conversion logic. Updates conversion function that converts from score to sun points to have different conversion rates
- (21 Gold -> ~29ish Gold at 60% progress in arena but we're running out of time so I'm killing this to send in the latest update before time runs out) Removes logic to do spooky avoidance completion, actions that give a decent sun point gain take priority over seeding, takes into account score when determining the best action in phase 1
- (78 Gold -> 19 Gold) Considers GROW and COMPLETE actions together in the sunPointSaver strategy, stops considering GROW actions on MEDIUM size trees for spooky avoidance, maxes out LARGE trees at 5
- (195 Gold -> 102 Gold) Avoid completion actions that will spend sun points that are worth more final score than the actual points gained for the COMPLETE, Add a fallback seeding algo that seeds distance 3 away (in a straight line) if the L strat has no viable seeding locations
- (235 Gold -> 195 Gold) Optimizes GROW actions for sun point differential with opponent rather than just our gain, Adds logic to COMPLETE trees early if we think they will stop some of our other trees from gaining sun points over the next two days
- (235 Gold No change, just resetting control since it's been a decent amount of time since it last ran
- (306 Gold -> 202 Gold) Update seeding algo to check for potential blockages since the "L" strategy doesn't fully stop us from blocking ourselves
- (713 Gold -> 325 Gold) Max small trees === 1
- (1135 Gold -> 713 Gold) "L" strategy for seeding to avoid blocking ourselves most of the time
- (221 Silver - GOLD!!!!) 2 actions per day during end game. seed from size 2+ trees only.
- (303 Silver -> 221 Silver) Spooked tree checker includes size 2 and size 3 trees. Seed logic is preferred over grow for same tree if seed is in high richness
- (253 Silver -> 303 Silver) Seed high richness cells 
- (502 Silver -> 253 Silver) Complete size 3 trees early if there'd be too many wasted days
- (716 Silver -> 502 Silver) Don't seed if there are two or more occupied adjacent cells
- (880 Silver -> 716 Silver) Seed on the cell with the highest richness. Seed based on tree size rather than just 1 distance away.
- (1255 Silver -> 880 Silver) Fix deepcopying bug. 
- (1140 Silver -> 1074 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us having the most sun points at the start of action phase in the next day
- (2052 Silver -> 1140 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us gaining the most sun points in the next sun collection phase
