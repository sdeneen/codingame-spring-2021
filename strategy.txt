Sick strat let's go.

General themes:
1. We have to complete more earlier.
2. Figure out completion strategy at the end. Doing a slow rollout of 2 completions per turn performed better than waiting until the last turn to complete everything. Find a more
data driven algorithm to complete in a good way
3. Start thinking about blocking opponent
4. Look at TODOs for optimizations in existing algo


Concrete ideas:
1. Optimize for sun point DIFFERENCE between us and oppo, not just our sun point gain
2. Basic end game completion strategy update: do whichever COMPLETE action gets us the most sun points next turn (maybe even tries to extrapolate to two turns)
	- could reference that same strategy in our early game completion logic as well

==== Old =====

Two sequences of play:
1. Sun gathering phase (engine building)
 - Try to GROW
 	 	- Break ties by largest tree
 	 	- (later) Break ties by picking whichever blocks more opponent sun points next turn
 - If we can't grow anything, SEED somewhere if it's free:
 		- position to block (maybe prioritize diagnols, aka "L" shapes, so we can't block ourselves)
		- Prefer areas with higher richness
		- Seed the biggest tree to spread across the forest - prevents blocking ourselves and makes it hardest for opponent

Optimizations:
- Down the road may need to add in logic to COMPLETE earlier to capitalize on high nutrient forest before opponent does

Add a phase 1.5 in here that prioritizes growing in richer areas

2. Point scoring phase (completing trees ftw)
 - This is pretty much the same as the strategy that got us out of Wood league, except prioritize largest trees first since they're closest to completion
 - Optimizations:
	- update getActionForCompleteTreesStrategy to calculate how many sun points it needs fully complete all trees. Then wait until the last possible turn complete everything so we can continue to collect sun points.
    - consider switching to complete phase based on board rather than % of game complete. E.g. N spaces are taken and it'd be better to start collection.
	- consider prioritizing completing trees that will be blocked the next turn
    - think about how to save sun points for future days, right now the algo goes wide across many trees but we may want to go deep

Tips:
- don't forget to check for richness = 0, which are cells that aren't usable

Changelog (most recent first):
FORMAT: (rankBefore -> rankAfter) Description of the change
- (444 Gold -> 343 Gold) Fixes dormant checks, updates COMPLETION logic from previous change to look two days ahead, stops growing trees that are gonna be spooked the next 2 turns, doesn't allow completes until day 11, starts end game logic on day 18 instead of 19 and spreads out late game actions even more, optimizes GROW actions for sun point differential with opponent rather than just our gain
- (381 Gold -> 415 Gold) Revert tree limit back to (1, 2, 4). Add logic to COMPLETE trees early if they will stop some of our other trees from gaining sun points next day
- (258 Gold -> 383 Gold) Update tree size limit to (2 small, 3 medium, 3 large). Add a fallback seeding algo that seeds distance 3 away (in a straight line) if the L strat has no viable seeding locations. In early game, don't allow GROW actions that have zero or negative sun point payoff
- (230 Gold -> 259 Gold) Define a limit per size of tree (1 small, 2 medium, 4 large). Try to complete once we've reached all tree size limits, enforcing earlier completion.
- (306 Gold -> 202 Gold) Update seeding algo to check for potential blockages since the "L" strategy doesn't fully stop us from blocking ourselves
- (713 Gold -> 325 Gold) Max small trees === 1
- (1135 Gold -> 713 Gold) "L" strategy for seeding to avoid blocking ourselves most of the time
- (221 Silver - GOLD!!!!) 2 actions per day during end game. seed from size 2+ trees only.
- (303 Silver -> 221 Silver) Spooked tree checker includes size 2 and size 3 trees. Seed logic is preferred over grow for same tree if seed is in high richness
- (253 Silver -> 303 Silver) Seed high richness cells 
- (502 Silver -> 253 Silver) Complete size 3 trees early if there'd be too many wasted days
- (716 Silver -> 502 Silver) Don't seed if there are two or more occupied adjacent cells
- (880 Silver -> 716 Silver) Seed on the cell with the highest richness. Seed based on tree size rather than just 1 distance away.
- (1255 Silver -> 880 Silver) Fix deepcopying bug. 
- (1140 Silver -> 1074 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us having the most sun points at the start of action phase in the next day
- (2052 Silver -> 1140 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us gaining the most sun points in the next sun collection phase
