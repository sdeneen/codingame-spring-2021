Sick strat let's go.

Two sequences of play:
1. Sun gathering phase (engine building)
 - Try to GROW
 	 	- Break ties by largest tree
 	 	- (later) Break ties by picking whichever blocks more opponent sun points next turn
 - If we can't grow anything, SEED somewhere if it's free:
 		- position to block (maybe prioritize diagnols so we can't block ourselves)

Optimizations:
- Down the road may need to add in logic to COMPLETE earlier to capitalize on high nutrient forest before opponent does

Add a phase 1.5 in here that prioritizes growing in richer areas

2. Point scoring phase (completing trees ftw)
 - This is pretty much the same as the strategy that got us out of Wood league, except prioritize largest trees first since they're closest to completion
 - Optimizations:
    - consider prioritizing completing trees that will be blocked the next turn
    - think about how to save sun points for future days, right now the algo goes wide across many trees but we may want to go deep

Tips:
- don't forget to check for richness = 0, which are cells that aren't usable

Changelog (reverse chronological order):
FORMAT: (rankBefore -> rankAfter) Description of the change
- (1255 Silver -> 1891 Silver) Fix deepcopying bug. No clue how the bug was helping us :/
- (1140 Silver -> 1074 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us having the most sun points at the start of action phase in the next day
- (2052 Silver -> 1140 Silver) Prioritize GROW trees for whichever results in us gaining the most sun points in the next sun collection phase
